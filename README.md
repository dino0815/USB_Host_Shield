This is a library for MAX3421E-based USB Host Shield for Arduino -> http://www.circuitsathome.com/arduino_usb_host_shield_projects

The development of this project has been discontinued. Current revision of the code can be found at https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0

Note from Sudar
-------------

I have added compatibility for [old Sparkfun USB Host shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9628) which had the pins swapped. To use this library with the old shield refer to this [blog post](http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/using-usb-host-shield-with-arduino) for instructions.
